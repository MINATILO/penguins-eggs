# Presentation
penguins-eggs is a console utility, in active development, who let you to
remaster your system and redistribuite it as iso images or from the lan via PXE
remote boot.

version of Linux, generate it as ISO image to burn on a CD/DVD or copy to a usb
key to boot your system. You can also boot your egg - via remote boot - on your

distros. At the moment it is tested with Debian 10 Buster, Debian 9 Stretch, Debian 8 Jessie,
Ubuntu 19.04 and derivates as Linux Mint and Bunsenlabs Helium. 
For others distros we need to find collaborations.

penguins-eggs, at the moment 2019 september 20 is in a beta state, and can have again
same troubles for people not in confidence with Linux system administration, but
can be already extremely usefull, You can easily create your organization/school 
version of Linux and deploy it on your LAN, give it to your friends as usb key 
or publish eggs in the internet!

scared, penguins-eggs is a console command - really very simple usage - if you
are able to open a terminal, you can use it.
