[General]

; You can change the location of  'snapshot_dir' (location of final iso file) 
;  in case you don't have enough space on the system. (Default: "/home/eggs")
snapshot_dir=/home/eggs


; You can change the rsync excludes file here if you know what you're 
; doing. Be sure to use the full path to the file.
; (Default is /usr/local/share/excludes/penguins-eggs-snapshot-exclude.list)
snapshot_excludes=/usr/local/share/penguins-eggs/exclude.list

; The name of the snapshot file will be hostname-{arch}_{yyyy-mm-dd_hhmm}.iso.
; If you'd like to replace "hostname" with something different,
; change it here. (example: snapshot_basename="my-buster-live")
; NB: hostname is for the name of the host
snapshot_basename=hostname

;Set to yes to create boot files for uefi.
make_efi=yes

; Change to "no" if you don't want the md5sum file created with the iso.
; Default is "yes"
make_md5sum=yes

; Change to "no" if you want a plain iso image instead of isohybrid.
; Default is "yes"
make_isohybrid=yes

; Compression algorithm
; Default is "xz". Allowed values in order of speed-size tradeoff: lz4, lzo, gzip, xz  
compression=xz

; Additional argulents to be pass to the mksquash options
; For exmaple you can add  "-b 262144" when you use xz compression for smaller, but slower builds
; not used from eggs
mksq_opt=

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Custom boot menu and help files section. 

; Change to "yes" if you want to be able to edit the boot menu or any
; other config files before the final image is made.
edit_boot_menu=no

; Sets the GUI editor used in the program 
; Use an absolute path here.
; (example: gui_editor=/usr/bin/leafpad)
gui_editor=/usr/bin/gedit


; Force the installation of calamares installer if it doesn't exist
; default is "yes"
force_installer=yes

# Change this if you want the live system to use other than the default
# kernel and initrd. You may need to edit the isolinux boot menu to
# match the filenames. (Also see custom boot menu section below.)
# Example: for kernel_image="/boot/vmlinuz-3.16.0-4-amd64" then the kernel
# line in the boot menu would contain:
#	 kernel /live/vmlinuz-3.16.0-4-amd64
#
# (Defaults are /vmlinuz and /initrd.img)
kernel_image = "/vmlinuz"
initrd_image = "/initrd.img"

# Allow users to mount all fixed drives with pmount for live iso.
# Refractainstaller removes this upon installation.
# (Default is "yes")

pmount_fixed=yes

# Allow password login to ssh for users (not root).
# If ssh_pass="yes", then PasswordAuthentication will be set to "yes"
# If ssh_pass="no", then PasswordAuthentication will be set to "no"
# In either of the above cases, if PermitRootLogin was set to "yes",
# it will be changed to "prohibit-password" (meaning with auth keys only)
# If ssh_pass is null or set to anything other than "yes" or "no", then
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config will not be altered.

ssh_pass=yes

# Uncomment to include your network configuration in the snapshot.
# This will preserve your /etc/network/interfaces and any saved wireless
# configurations. This works for NetworkManager, simple-netaid/netman
# and wicd.  
# It will also add "ip=frommedia" to the boot command, so that the saved
# configuration will be used.
# Default is commented; interfaces file in $work_dir/myfs gets replaced
# and only contains the loopback interface.
#
# NOTE!!! If you're using some other network manager, and you don't want
# your configs to be copied, you need to add the appropriate files to
# the excludes list. (Tell me what those files are, and I'll fix 
# refractasnapshot to handle it.)

#netconfig_opt=ip=frommedia

# Uncomment to use old or new style interface names.
# Use net.ifnames=0 to force old interface names with udev. (eth0)
# Use net.ifnames=1 to force new interface names with eudev. (enp0s1)

#ifnames_opt=net.ifnames=0

# If the primary user's name is not "live", then live-boot needs to see
# the user's name in the boot command. In that case, the script will
# automatically add the correct option. If you set a user name here, it
# will override that process. Use this if you want to log into the live
# media as someone other than the primary user (i.e. any user whose
# uid:gid are not 1000:1000.)
user_live=lillo
