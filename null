Setup Instructions for EGGS CLI Autocomplete ---

1) Add the autocomplete env var to your bash profile and source it
$ printf "eval $(eggs autocomplete:script bash)" >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc

NOTE: If your terminal starts as a login shell you may need to print the init script into ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile.

2) Test it out, e.g.:
$ eggs <TAB><TAB>                 # Command completion
$ eggs command --<TAB><TAB>       # Flag completion

Enjoy!
