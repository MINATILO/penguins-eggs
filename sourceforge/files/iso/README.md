# Penguin's eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian Buster, Ubuntu Focal, Linux Mint 19.x and Deepin 20 Beta. 

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# ISOs

I work mostly on Debian stable, so here you can find my personal versions and other examples.

# Debian
## buster
I divided it in three parts: cinnamon, lxde and naked. The two in cinnamon are the most complete and are the tools with i work:
debu to develop and office automatition and incubator, a version of proxmox-ve sistem with filled with all you can expect from 
a complete:

* **naked** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386 and amd64)

* **less** - it's not naked, but just dressed with lxde-core and the tools to develop. (i386 and amd64)

* **debu**  - it is my personal version with cinnamon, mostly for development, but include common office tools; (amd64)

* **incubator** - Debian Buster + Proxmox VE 6.2 and the same tools of debu; (amd64 plus virtualization enabled)

## bullseye

* **naked** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386 and amd64)

* **lite** - just dressed with xfce, firefox, visual studio code, nodejs and stacer (amd64 and i386)

All the other distro are non divided, but just a directory, the name is usually the distro version name. Example: focal, bionic, etc.

You can create remix from yourself by downloading the originals, installing the system, installing eggs and start to creatie the ISOs.
