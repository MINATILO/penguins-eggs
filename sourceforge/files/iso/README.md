# Penguin's eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian Buster, Ubuntu Focal, Linux Mint 19.x and Deepin 20 Beta. 

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# ISOs

I work mostly on Debian stable, so here you can find my personal versions and other examples.

## Debian Buster
* **debu**  - it is my personal version with cinnamon, mostly for development, but include common office tools;
* **lampp** - same as debu, but with tools to develop web sites with php and wordpress;
* **naked** - just the juice, without GUI, with nodejs and eggs. You can start here to build your revolution! 
* **less** - it's just naked, dressed with lxde-core and the tools to work.
* **blockchain** - I'm not a blockchain expert, the idea is to give an example of that is possible to build with eggs. I mean an an ISO image to giveup to * students for learn blockchain, develop smart contracts, etc. Feel free to give suggestions on it or ask for help to build your own version.
* **incubator** - Debian Buster + Proxmox VE 6.2 and the same tools of debu;

## Linux Mint Debian Edition 4 
* **lmde4** - LMDE4 Debbie, remastered with eggs, without any modifications except for develop tools.

## Linux Mint 19.3
* **tricia** - Linux Mint 19.3 remastered with eggs, without any modifications except for develop tools.

## Deepin 20 beta
* **dpin** - deepin 20 beta apricot remastered with eggs, without any modifications except for develop tools.

## Ubuntu 20.04 focal
* **ufo-mini** - Ubuntu focal minimal installation, remastered with eggs, without any modifications except for develop tools.

# That's all Folks!
No need other configurations, penguins-eggs are battery included or better, as in the real, live is inside! :-D
