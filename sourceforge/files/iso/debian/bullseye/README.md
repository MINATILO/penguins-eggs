* **naked** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386 and amd64)
* **xfce** - it's not naked, but just dressed with xfce4 and firefox. You can from here for a lite xfce remix. (i386)
* **mate** - it's not naked, but just dressed with mate and firefox.  You can from here for a lite mate remix. (i386)
* **gnome** - it's not naked, but just dressed with gnome and firefox. You can from here for a lite mate remix. (i386)
