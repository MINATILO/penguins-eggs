# Debian remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian jessie

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

# Debian jessie

* **naked** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386 and amd64)

## Note on Debian 8 jessie
On Debian 8 jessie it is not possible to use eggs with the original kernel 3.16, due the lack of overlayfs. This feature is available only from the 3.19 version of the kernel. I managed, however, to produce the iso, after installing a backported kernel (4.9.0-0.bpo.12-amd64) who suppert overlayfs.

After was necessary to install the follow packages (from Debian stretch repository):
* live-boot_20170112_all.deb
* live-boot-initramfs-tools_20170112_all.deb

and we solved almost all the problems.

For same reasons - I don't know at the moment, eggs compiled on different version of Debian don't want to run correctly on the system and end with the error:

* Error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.9' not found (required by /usr/lib/penguins-eggs/node_modules/drivelist/build/Release/drivelist.node)

I solved this simply recompiling eggs directly on Debian jessie.

# Warning: 
__upgrading eggs on jessie with a standard version will lead to an inability to install__.

# Disclaim
__Please note what this project is in no way connected to Debian in any official way, itâ€™s just my personal experiment__.
