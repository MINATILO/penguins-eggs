# Debian remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian stretch

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

* **egg-of-debian-naked-lxqt** - just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution! (i386 and amd64)
* **egg-of-debian-stretch-lite** - it's not naked, but just dressed with xfce4 and the tools to develop. (i386 and amd64)
* **egg-of-debian-stretch-lxqt**  - it is my personal version with cinnamon, mostly for development, but include common office tools; (amd64)

Debian stretch is an old version of Debian, can't use calamares installer. Use eggs cli installer.

```sudo eggs install --cli```

and follow the instructions.

__Note__ Be sure to work without risks, cli installer can delete all yours datas, can't coesist with others system, etc. Use at your own risk. Backup your data before to try and use only for old machines - for new ones use calamares - no warranties here.

I made this version in the hope it can be usefull for old computers. There are a lot of distros you can try, but with eggs the question is a bit different, you can build your version on a virtual machine, change every aspects, check if you need other software, check the precence of your driver, install them and so on. At last ypu can produce the iso image and try it in your old pc.

I think it is fantastic! :-p
