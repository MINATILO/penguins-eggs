# Releases

Complete sources releases from github.

# Collaboration

A suitable way to start to collaborate in penguin's eggs development can be to install one of them (I suggest debu) or install nodejs, git, build-essential in in your personal system, and start to play with penguins-eggs source.

It is quite simple! Just download penguins-eggs the sources with the command:

```git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs```


Install in it the necessary npm packages:

```cd penguins-egg```

```npm i```

And now, from the same directory, you can use eggs from sources:

```~/penguins-eggs$ .\eggs info```

```~/penguins-eggs$ sudo .\eggs produce -fv```

You can also use choose the option -d (--dry) and play later with the scripts in /home/eggs/ovarium. Can be exciting! ;-)

Don't esitate to ask me for suggestions and help.
