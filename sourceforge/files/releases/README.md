# Releases

Complete sources releases from github.

# Collaboration

I'm finding collaborators, if you are interested, you can help!

Not only developers, yes devs are important, but also graphics, translators (i made traslation with google translator, yes are good but need to be revised) and so on.

If you are interested, please write me!

For developers and testers, a suitable way to start to collaborate in penguin's eggs development can be to install one of them (I suggest debu) or install nodejs, git, build-essential in in your personal system, and start to play with penguins-eggs source.

It is quite simple! Just download penguins-eggs the sources with the command:

```git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs```


Install in it the necessary npm packages:

```cd penguins-egg```

```npm i```

And now, from the same directory, you can use eggs from sources:

```~/penguins-eggs$ .\eggs info```

```~/penguins-eggs$ sudo .\eggs produce -fv```

You can also use choose the option -d (--dry) and play later with the scripts in /home/eggs/ovarium. Can be exciting! ;-)

Don't esitate to ask me for suggestions and help.

# That's all Folks!
No need other configurations, penguins-eggs are battery included or better, as in the real, live is inside! :-D
