# Penguin's eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian Buster, Ubuntu Focal and Deepin 20 Beta. 

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can
update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```


I work mostly on Debian stable, so here you can find my personal versions and other examples.

A suitable way to start to collaborate in penguin's eggs development can be install debu, and play
with penguins-eggs source.

It is quite simple, just download penguins-eggs
```git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs```
```cd penguins-egg```
```npm i```
and, now you can start eggs directly from sources;
```.\eggs info```
```.\eggs produce -fv```
and so on.

## Debian Buster
* **debu**  - it is my personal version with cinnamon, mostly for development, but include common office tools;
* **lampp** - same as debu, but with tools to develop web sites with php and wordpress;
* **incubator** - Debian Buster + Proxmox VE 6.2 and the same tools of debu;
* **blockchain** - I'm not a blockchain expert, the idea is to give an example of that is possible to build with eggs. I mean an an ISO image to giveup to students for learn blockchain, develop smart contracts, etc. Feel free to give suggestions on it or ask for help to build your own version.
